# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
Both `.then` and `.catch` are methods used within promise to manage asynchronous operations, and both take callback functions to generate a new promise in the process. 

`.then` is used to handle the successful completion of a promise. 

`.catch` is used to handle errors or rejections that occur when getting the promise.
