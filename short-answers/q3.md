# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

Calling `resolve()` or `reject()` inside the function passed to the Promise constructor is what will determine whether the promise produces a value (fulfills/resolve) or produces an error (rejects).

Option b is not entirely accurate. While calling resolve() or reject() inside the executor function is necessary to fulfill or reject the promise, returning them doesn't affect the behavior of the promise itself. Returning from the executor function has no impact on the promise.
