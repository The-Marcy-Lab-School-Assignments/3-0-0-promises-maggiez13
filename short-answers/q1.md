# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` will print first and then the `Inside promise` as `Outside promise` is synchronous code and `Inside promise` is asynchronous code. In this specific case, the synchronous code will run before the asynchronous code as it is encountered before the promise's `then` callback function. 

# Teacher Feedback

Small correction, synchronous will always run first but otherwise you are correct!
