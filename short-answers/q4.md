# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The arguments passed into `resolve/reject` functions are used to either resolve or reject the promise. 

When `resolve(value)` is called, the promise is fulfilled, and the state changes to resolved. The `value` passed to `resolve` becomes the fulfillment value of the promise, where it is accessible by `.then`.

When `reject(reason)` is called, the promise is rejected, and the state changes to rejected. The `reason` passed to `reject` represents the cause for the promise's rejection. The reason can be accessed by the `.catch` method.
